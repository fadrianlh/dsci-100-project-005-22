# DSCI 100 Final Project – Minecraft Subscription Predictor

This project explores a dataset of Minecraft players and uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a player is likely to subscribe based on their age and total playtime.

##  Project Overview

We used R and the tidyverse framework to:
- Load and wrangle real-world player data
- Apply upsampling to balance classes
- Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model
- Tune hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Evaluate model performance

##  Goal

To build a predictive model that can help game developers or marketers target potential subscribers more effectively.
